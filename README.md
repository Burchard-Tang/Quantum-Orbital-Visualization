# Quantum Orbital Visualization

A 3D visualization of electron orbitals generated by solving the **time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation** using **GNU Octave**.

This project explores how different quantum numbers ‚Äî *n*, *l*, and *m* ‚Äî determine the shapes of atomic orbitals. By plotting the resulting probability densities as scatter plots, it provides an intuitive way to see the structure of quantum mechanical wavefunctions.

## üß† Overview

- **Goal:** Visualize hydrogen-like atomic orbitals by solving the Schr√∂dinger equation numerically.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Compute radial and angular components of the wavefunction for given quantum numbers.  
  - Generate a 3D probability cloud using `scatter3` in GNU Octave.  
- **Inspiration:** Based on the differential equations and quantum mechanics sections from *Jeffery R. Chasnov‚Äôs* lecture notes.
